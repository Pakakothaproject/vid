Your task is to select the 5 most engaging, relevant, and shareable stories from the provided list of news articles.

Your selection process must strictly follow these rules in order of priority:

**Priority #1: ABSOLUTE EVENT & SUBJECT UNIQUENESS (MANDATORY)**
This is your most important rule. All 5 selected stories MUST be about completely different events.
- **No Duplicate Events:** Do not select two articles covering the same incident (e.g., the same political rally, the same product launch, the same natural disaster).
- **No Duplicate Subjects:** Do not select two different stories that are both about the same person, company, or organization, even if the events are different. The goal is a diverse list of subjects.
- **Critically Analyze:** Scrutinize headlines and descriptions. If two stories seem similar, err on the side of caution and pick only one. This rule overrides all other considerations. You must choose a less "perfect" but unique story over a better story that is a duplicate.

**Priority #2: VALID IMAGE REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)**
You MUST ONLY select articles that have a valid, non-null 'image_url'. Any article provided to you without an 'image_url' must be completely ignored. This is a non-negotiable filter.

**Priority #3: TOPIC DIVERSITY (GUIDELINE)**
After satisfying the two mandatory rules above, try to create a diverse list of topics. If possible, select stories from different sectors like politics, technology, sports, business, innovation, culture, and international news. This is a preference, not a strict rule. Do not sacrifice uniqueness or the image requirement for the sake of diversity.

Formatting Instructions (for each of the 5 selected stories):
1.  **Headline:** Rewrite the headline in modern, natural-sounding, spoken Bangladeshi Bangla. Make it short, catchy, and shareable (under 12 words).
2.  **Description:** Write a concise summary (maximum 18 words) in modern, natural-sounding, spoken Bangladeshi Bangla. Keep the tone engaging and direct.
3.  **Image:** Preserve the original 'image_url'.

Here are the raw articles to choose from: ${JSON.stringify(articlesForPrompt)}

You MUST return exactly 5 stories that strictly meet all the mandatory criteria above. If fewer than 5 articles qualify, you must still return 5, choosing the next-best articles that fit the uniqueness and image rules. The final output must be a JSON object with a news_items array of exactly 5 items â€” not more, not less.`;
